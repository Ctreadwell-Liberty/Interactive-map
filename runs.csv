This pattern continued throughout the slide, with overpull reaching up to 80,000 pounds over the string weight when picking up out of the slide.

Throughout the run, temperatures ranged from 170?F from drill out to 296?F in the lateral. Building the curve took longer than anticipated due to erratic TF?s when sliding but eventually cleaned up once transitioning into the eagle ford shale. Build rates suffered during the curve but were able to achieve a sufficient DLS in the eagle ford to land 8? low of the TL. The assembly maintained an average differential pressure of 400 psi building the curve & 800 psi drilling the lateral, with an average weight on bit (WOB) of 40,000 pounds and an average rotary speed of 75 RPM. The flow rate during the operation ranged between 500 and 700 GPM. The assembly predominantly held the planned trajectory in rotation. In slide mode, the motor achieved an average yield of 12? per 100.

The diff was holding in strong, so it wasnt a sign the motor was getting weak but with the very low ROP we had concerns the bit was getting bad. They decided to keep drilling. When we made the connection at 17,443 MD and went back to drilling, ROP had almost doubled but now the torque was very erratic (25-16K). Looking at drilling parameters, we noticed that the driller was still running 35K on bit, but the hook load was now 247K while drilling. Before the connection the hook load was 260K with 35K on bit and after the connection we had 247K hook load with 35K weight on bit. Went over and talked to CoMan about how we had a bad rezero on bit weight. He told me that there?s no way to reset the hook load. I told him i understood that, but you can rezero the weight at any given point. He didnt grasp the fact that we were now running 48K on the bit weight with a 247K hook load. He told me not to worry about it. After watching the erratic torque for a while, I went back over and discussed possible bit damage and the possibility of damaging the motor with the erratic torque. I was concerned that the bit was coring with the excessive torque swings. I was told that i didnt know WTF i was talking about that we were in shale, and it couldnt core a bit. We continued to drill with high weight and extreme torque until 17,535 MD at that point we lost torque and the diff fell off slightly. At that point CoMan called and ask what was wrong. I explained it wasnt the motor because we could still get some diff when tagging bottom, but the bit was probably smooth and has probably been under gauge for a while.

 Drilled to 754, at which point we started, built, and held Tangent. At 2,187 we increased GPM to 900 GPM and pumped a sweep. During the course of drilling that stand down after increasing GPM and pumping sweep, we experienced a constant and significant increase in SPP. After making a connection and kicking the pumps on, pressure showed to be 4,050 PSI off bottom with 800 GPM @ bit depth of 2,187, as where SPP off bottom was 1800 PSI @ 888 GPM @ bit depth 1,795.
 After swapping pumps and attempting varying GPM off bottom for troubleshooting purposes, decison was made to rotate one stand. Pressure no longer increased, but did remain very high around 4,000 PSI SPP at 780 GPM while drilling stand down. An attempt to slide at top of next stand was unsuccessful; toolface control was still easily attained, yet weight stacked with no ROP.
  Decision was made at this point to TOH and change BHA.

 BHA showed a definite tendency to build throughout run. GPM used while drilling varied from 480 GPM to 630 GPM, depending on what lost circulation issues were being experienced at any given time.
  While TOH at TD, upon TOH to 4,964 (above Surface casing shoe), rig attempted to pump a slug, but couldnt pump through string. Rig continued to TOH wet for rest of trip.
  Upon clearing rotary, motor had no squat and no visible exterior damage. Float in motor was packed with LCM, but would actuate upon pressing plunger. Attempts to drain motor were unsuccessful; motor was locked up. Bit missing cutter at nose, as well as chipped cutters on gauge rows.

No major walking tendencies observed.  Once vertical the BHA walked around to the North and started building angle  up to 1.23 deg.  Once in the Hosston the BHA started spudding itself over and over due to how the auto driller was set up.  Recommended to the operator to adjust the auto driller parameters to keep it from spudding.

This assembly was planned to kick off with a build rate of 13/100. Early in the curve, the motor yielded up to 21/100 with good tool face control while holding 800 psi differential and 20k WOB.
At 11,083 MD, five motor stalls were encountered over a 20 interval. Following each stall, tool face was re-established with difficulty. After the stalls, differential dropped to ~500 psi with 810k WOB, and intermittent pressure spikes further impacted tool face control. Build rates had begun to fall off prior to the motor stall interval, down to 9.7, despite consistent slide execution and adequate WOB and differential.
A decision was made to trip out and pick up a more aggressive motor configuration to achieve the required 17.6/100 to land on plan. The assembly was pulled at 11,144 MD (bit depth), with inclination projected at 28.71 at 11,137 MD, short of landing.
